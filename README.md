## Description
Finally, relief for pet owners and their families has arrived.  We have created an app based on our client's specifications for  features that would allow pet owners respite from overpriced pet hotels and dirty kennels with Swap Paws.  This app connects pet owners with other pet lovers so your pet can be spared a traumatic experience and you can save money.  Pet owners can trade services with other pet owners as well as purchase services. Built with :heart: in collaboration with [BlakeMeyer](https://github.com/blakeynwa) and [CarterMcGee](https://github.com/carterm912).

## Functionality

### Book Pet Services 

> Search through the list of available pet owners with the date, time, and distance.  Pick the right pet sitter by reading their reviews. 


### Pet Reviews
> Creating a level of trust was intrinsic in allowing a loved pet in a stranger's care, so we felt it was important to be able to review the experience and crowd source ratings.  

### Neighborhood Service
> To differentiate our app, our client decided to create on a community friendly app that allowed pet owners to trade services by accumulating tokens that could be traded on a per service request basis.  That way a token could easily be traded to the person providing the pet service.   By default a user has three tokens to start with, however if a user doesn't have any tokens, these may be purchased.
